# Artificial-Neural-Networks

For the EPFL course in Artificial Neural Network, students are asked to work in pairs in order to complete a project consisting of two miniprojects.
They consist in along notebook to be filled in while other parts are already prepared by the teaching assistants.

#Miniproject 1

The aim is to perform classification on the MNIST dataset. We compared the performance of fully connected and convolutional neural networks

#Miniproject 2

The aim is to create a chatbot using Recurrent Neural Networks using as building blocks LSTM and GRU. In addition, we used NLP techniques to find meaningful numerical representations of words

Please look at the 2 Jupyter notebooks for the complete overview over our work
